# TensorFlow - TensorFlow Object Detection API

## Setup - TensorFlow Object Detection API

* In folder **/setup** you'll find the instructions (tf_object_detection_api_setup_w10.pdf) **[Spanish]** for installing de API in Windows 10.
* In folder **/setup** you'll find a file "run_protoc.bat.txt". This file is referenced in the instructions, remove the .txt extension for the execution.

## PoCs - TensorFlow Object Detection API

* Main Folder: /src/pocs/

* **PoC - Object Detection Tutorial:**
  * Folder: /src/pocs/object detection tutorial/
  * In the folder you'll find 2 files:
    * **poc_object_detection_tutorial_notes.pdf** [Spanish] is the notes for the tutorial execution.
    * **object_detection_tutorial.ipynb** is the notebook for the PoC. For the sake of simplicity, move this file to "TensorFlowFolder/models/research/object_detection" route in your machine.

* **PoC - Object Detection Camera:**
  * Folder: /src/pocs/object detection camera/
  * In the folder you'll find 2 files:
    * **poc_object_detection_camera.py** is the python code for the PoC. For the sake of simplicity, move this file to "TensorFlowFolder/models/research/object_detection" route in your machine.
